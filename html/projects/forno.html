                    monkey energy that night. But I really was looking forward to a magical pizzA double billing. Alas,
                    it was never meant to be. "

                    your humble narrator. It’s advertised as Neapolitan, and you can see the pie well beforehand. The
                    charring on the crust looks incredible, the cheese looks well apportioned and the basil looks…
                    menacing. It all appears to be very above board. Very horrorshow. Until you actually get the pizza.

                    honey is quite frankly anything but. Its loose unspecified sweet sauce with errant chilli flakes
                    sprinkled all around and mixed. I would’ve been mad if I wasn’t so confused. Their garlic butter was
                    pretty good though, however, its fairly hard to mess up garlic butter. Its garlic, and butter (then
                    again, what then is hot honey if not honey, and… hot?)."

                    looked somewhat the same as the pictures. But oh my brothers, did it taste like the horse’s tail.
                    The dough was flavourless and chewy, the cheese HORRENDOUSLY uninspired (and that’s the worst crime
                    cheese can commit), and the tomato sauce tasted straight out of a can. I was pleasantly surprised
                    that it was edible however, despite all of this, so, unsurprisingly, I cleaned my plate, paid my
                    bill, and thanked the waiter. To all unsuspecting onlookers, I had a succulent Italian meal…

                    Interestingly enough, I haven’t seen such a large percentage of older – and specifically white –
                    expat males in one place for all the ‘uhmmm akksshuallllyyyy’ warriors out there, not only am I
                    being slightly hyperbolic, the key words here are old, male, and, say it after me: PERCENTAGE. As a
                    ratio to the rest of the diners, it was definitely quite odd, especially at that time of day.
                    However, I might have caught it at a unique time. But that’s besides the point.

                    here, because we do eat quite a number of ‘poop varieties’ from the animal kingdom, either knowingly
                    or unknowingly). It was just very sad food, advertised and priced as very very good food. I mean, it
                    wasn’t hugely expensive, but for the size and quality at the end of the day, absolutely gonna have
                    to give this one a DNR out of 69. There's a time and place for this kind of pizza experience, and I
                    pray I never find myself there, or the hands on my watch pointing to it.
