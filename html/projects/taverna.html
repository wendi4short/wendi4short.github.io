                    of person. If I had high hopes, and your immediate now is not great, you don’t do great. If I had
                    low hopes, and your immediate now is not great, I don’t get lower hopes, nor do I excuse it because
                    I wasn’t expecting much. You also just don’t do great. "

                    "Considering their commitment to keeping prices low (especially with their Wednesday special), it’s
                    important that they don’t skimp on quality. They offer up simple and consistent Pizza, with quite a
                    lot to praise. Although they don’t do too well on a reheat, a fresh pie gives you a wonderful cheese
                    pull, a wonderfully crunchy undercarriage (provided the kitchen isn’t choking on itself that night),
                    and a comfortably wonder- acceptable sauce. It’s a great slice from top to bottom, and (and I mean
                    this in the best possible way), leaves more to be desired, as opposed to having you regret eating
                    it. "

                    dining alone or with companions, which is quite rare in Lagos restaurant-only joints), and an
                    expectation that your car will still be parked outside when you get there, Nights at La Taverna
                    always find a way to be a net-positive. Now this doesn’t exactly scream top-billing, but still – a
                    decent, consistent and accessible place is always a plus in my books.

                    While not always front-and-centre, I definitely don’t believe this is exactly in ‘if you know, you
                    know’ territory, either. On the contrary, I am quite certain that enough people are well aware of
                    the wonders that go on within those flower-laden walls. However, just in case you didn’t, I’ll tell
                    you: Tres Leches. "

                    cross, as I wasn’t exactly a TL connoisseur before I tried theirs, but I have now done quite a bit
                    more exploring, and till date, they remain unbeaten in this regard. It’s the combination of
                    something, for sure, although I’m not sure what it is (this just in, local human discovers the
                    results of cooking are borne from a ‘combination of something’). No part independently stands out as
                    particularly spectacular, and I have tasted better versions of individual components elsewhere.
                    However, there is just something about the way they come together. Idk. Perhaps there’s some latin
                    maxim or old adage about a completed product being better than the combination of its pieces. But I
                    wouldn’t know. I’ve never heard such a thing before.

                    cake into my review, and give them a 24601 out of pinchar. Its good eats, and its easy eats, and we
                    love to see it."
