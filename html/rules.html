                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 1. If it has a conveyor belt oven, it’s out (I’m
                    sorry Dominos/Dodo
                    Pizza, but this series isn’t for you).
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 2. While I would love to ‘One Bite’ this ordeal,
                    our lord and savior Mr. Dave Portnoy already seems
                    to have a monopoly on that (and a pretty shitty one at that, since he takes like 6 bites before
                    giving out a review, these days anyway), I will eat to my fill before documenting this. Therefore,
                    the ‘moreishness’ of the pie is also part of the criteria.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 3. I am a firm believer that being a purist is
                    healthy, and would consequently strive, where
                    possible, to start every place’s review with a simple Margherita (will be used interchamngeably with
                    cheese. Don’t you dare come at me) slice, to properly pull out the best qualities of their pizza
                    (i.e., the aforementioned dough, tomatoes and milk<sup>2</sup>).

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 4. Disregard rule ‘3’ above. If a place’s
                    Margherita or regular cheese slice is looking
                    underwhelming (and I’d imagine most places’ would), I will opt for a more entertaining slice.
                    However, places that are reviewed on their cheese slice would get bonus points in this regard.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 5. Assume every visit that the founder/chief chef
                    has prepared the pizza. Places are entitled to
                    follow up reviews on different pizzas, but joints with abysmal reviews get no second chances.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 6. To preserve the quality of the pie, pizzas
                    would be picked up from the store, and the first
                    slice would be tried straight out of the oven. In extenuating circumstances, where delivery is
                    required, slight leeway will be given for any assumed drop in quality.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 7. Re-eatability of the slice (this is a house of
                    leftovers) would positively factor in to the
                    review (In english, a sub par slice might become a good slice if its just as good/better on reheat.
                    However, a good slice does not become a bad slice should it be deemed inedible after 12 hours in the
                    fridge).

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 8. Unique (to this side of the world) slices such
                    as the New York Style, Neapolitan, Deep Dish,
                    Apizza, just to name a few, would attract bonus points.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 9. Have fun. None of these rules really matter in
                    the face of good food.

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 2.0;"> 10. Don’t we all just love those nice round
                    numbers?
