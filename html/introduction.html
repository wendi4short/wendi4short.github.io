                <li>I am one of the MANY believers that Lagos is a city that is bereft of good choices. There’s the
                    glitz and the glam, the (half baked (Ha. That would be funny later)) neon lights illusion of choice,
                    but really, its all just a sham. At the end of the day, any truly pioneering place is either a
                    victim of lounge syndrome, or is built up to prioritise Vibes over quality. Which is fine. The
                    people vote with their wallets, and style over substance sells in droves here. However, I amidst the
                    wasteland that is the low budget, high cost experience we so frequently have on offer, there are a
                    few gems that shine that have either stood the test of time, or have just stepped into the arena,
                    starry eyed and full of good intentions, yet to be hammered down into shape. </li>
                <li>In an effort to find and hopefully identify trends to better identify such places in the future, I
                    have started a journey to attempt to see through the muck. </li>

                <li>Don’t get me wrong, dear Reader (yes, that’s you, in the corner), for I’m not an altruist. This
                    venture is exclusively for my benefit and record keeping purposes. You are merely a spectator.
                    Nonetheless, you are permitted to glean whatever benefit you so choose from this exercise.</li>
                <li>And what is this exercise, you ask? Well since you’re so desperately eager to find out (really,
                    relax. It’s not a good look on you), I’ll tell you.</li>
                <li>Pizza. This series will explore the wonderful world of bread and sauce and cheese, and all that
                    comes with it in this stinky little city of dreams, traffic, and ‘Do you know who I am?’. I will be
                    cataloguing my pizza experiences, in an effort to discover what truly is the best Pizza spot in
                    Lagos.</li>
